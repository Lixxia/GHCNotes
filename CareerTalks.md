### Networking on the Introvert's Side of the Room
### Michele Marut
- introverts: are everywhere, prefer small groups, recharge alone
- tech activites leverage introvert traits
- networking: many uses, relies on relationships
- dunbar's number: effectively maintain relationships with 150 people maximum
Four ways introverts can build their network
1. Engage in online communities
	- jump in
	- post during events
	- share your knowledge
2. Attend low-key events
	- go casual
	- bring your favorite people
	- step away if you need to recharge
3. Attend activity based events
	- pick fun things
	- act early
	- look for activites within conferences
4. volunteer at the event
	- work the sign-in table
	- chat with volunteers
- remember to maintain the network!
- offer your resources to others
