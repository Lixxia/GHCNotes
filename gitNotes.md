I only took note of commands new/interesting to me, I would advise following other git tutorials for a more comprehensive look at git and gitHub. (Or feel free to ask me questions!)

**git revert**
- creates a new commit in history that is the inverse of the previous commit (the inverse of what happens)
- will show in history 

**git rebase**
- allows you to rewrite history.
- pretty complicated, be careful.

**revert-pullrequest button on github (doesn't edit the history)**
- be careful about commands that edit history, can mess with others workflow 

**git cherrypick**
- pull in bugfix to the branch

**git stache**
- put something in a special area (copypasta for repo changes)
- downside: maybe merge conflicts
